- Gateway Core runtime is configured via Gateway mediation language 
which can be visually represented in a sequence diagram-like design.   
- Lightweight, fully non-blocking mediation runtime. 
- Control Structures, Logging, Header and Content-based Routing, Type-aware messaging
- This runtime if fully extensible to built other advanced solutions such as Integration server (next-gen ESB), Data Integration Server, etc.
